## Product Description:
Develop a set of water sensors designed for seamless installation on residential roof water drains. Engineered with the goal of monitoring and detecting any accumulation of water resulting from storms, debris, and other environmental factors. The technology will also track water flow rates, providing insights for effective drainage management via the interconnected  mobile application. 

## Benefit Proposition:
Our target groups will be the people who are not able to regularly climb up and down to check the situation of the drainage system on their rooftops, such as elderly people. By  delivering reliable and timely data, we aim to empower individuals to proactively monitor the state of their roof drainage systems, mitigating potential damage and ensuring a safer, more sustainable environment for all.

## Key Business Goals:	
The app will require a water level sensor (each 5$) as well as a water flow sensor (13 $). We plan to sell our devices for 25$ (the app itself could be free, but will not have a function with  no sensor device connected) yielding a 7$ per unit sold gross margin. Our team will spend about 300 hours creating the application at 50$ per hour for a total of 15000$. We will need to sell 2143 units to break even. As this can be very useful from a homeowner perspective for a relatively cheap price, we believe this goal will be achieved. There may also be potential for installation fees, multiple sensors for some houses to increase precision, as well as contracts with insurance companies.

## Target Market:
The target audience for this product would be the average homeowner who is looking for peace of mind when it comes to the safety of their roofing due to water accumulation. This extends further to people with reduced movement such as the elderly and the disabled. We believe this product would also be appealing to insurance companies as a way to promote a safer household and reduce personal monthly insurance costs.

## Assumptions:
We can find or build the proper sensors for the intended specifications.
Build the product to have a decent life-cycle as it will be exposed to the elements.
Engineer the product to have a long battery life, or figure a clever way to power the sensor for long periods of time.

## Constraints:
- The project should be completed by December 4th 
- The materials of the product must be resistant to its environment
- The product should be accurate and not provide false positives
- Maintenance should be kept to a minimum
- Scalability should be possible

## Stakeholders:
- Users of the product
- Distributors and developers of the included software
- Suppliers for the materials, sensors and microcontrollers
- The Google Play store that hosts the Application download
- Possibly insurance companies who collaborate with use
